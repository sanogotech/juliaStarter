Import Python's math module in Julia (Source)
The beauty is that you can very easily mix Python and Julia this way. Python's entire ecosystem including all its great libraries are available while you can also explore Julia's ecosystem. In fact Plots.jl, a plotting library for Julia can use PyPlot as one of its backends.

A neat feature of Julia is that you can use LaTeX shortcuts in the editor. For example when you type \sqrt<TAB> most Julia editors and the Julia REPL will automatically turn this sequence into the square-root sign: √. In this case √ is also aliased to the sqrt function.  This makes Julia great for mathematical applications where you can use mathematical notation in your programs.
